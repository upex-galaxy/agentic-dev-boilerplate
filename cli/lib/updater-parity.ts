/**
 * @fileoverview Parity report after `bun run up`: ONE table of what still
 * differs from upstream per surface, with concrete evidence, and ONE prompt the
 * user hands to their AI so every row gets a decision (keep project | take
 * upstream | merge) BEFORE anything is edited.
 *
 * Inputs are collected by the wrapper at afterApply time, while the upstream
 * clone is still on disk:
 *
 *  - protected watchlist entries that drifted this run (`updater-drift.ts`);
 *  - the compatibility check (`checkAgentCompatibility`): its errors are the
 *    only BLOCKING findings, and the MCP set errors are folded per host. When a
 *    compat error and a watched-file drift name the SAME path, they fold into
 *    one row (compat evidence first, drift evidence appended);
 *  - skills the cross-harness migration archived because `.agents/skills/`
 *    already owned the name (this run's, plus any archive dir entry that has
 *    not been nudged yet; one marker per skill under `.template/upstream-sha/`);
 *  - the retired command-alias overlay when a project still has one (one
 *    informational row), and every project command the compat hook moved
 *    aside because it carried a skill's name (one informational row each);
 *  - components held back this run, with their lock commits;
 *  - `.env` keys upstream documents and the project lacks;
 *  - the `git_strategy` provenance stamp in `.agents/project.yaml`.
 *
 * Rules: no finding without evidence (a heading, a key, a server id, a count);
 * ids are sequential per run; the prompt speaks in headings and sections,
 * never in rule numbers. Full diffs go to the saved file, never to the terminal.
 * A `merge` on a watched file always says what to port and what to keep (the
 * upstream additions vs the project-only keys or sections); a structural
 * (identity) file compares keys only and fires, labelled `informational`, for
 * upstream additions alone.
