# CONTEXT.md — Context Engineering in This Repo

> **Last update**: 2026-09-03
> **Purpose**: Canonical, operational explanation of how `agentic-dev-boilerplate` structures context so AI agents work effectively against it.
> **Audience**: Humans onboarding the repo, and AI agents that need to understand "where things live and why".
> **Companion files**: `README.md` (overview for humans), `AGENTS.md` (the always-on core of the operational rules, loaded each session on every supported harness, with a router to the sections under `.agents/instructions/`; `CLAUDE.md` is a one-line `@AGENTS.md` shim that Claude Code follows to reach it, see §2.1), `docs/agentic-development-engineering.md` (methodology deep dive).

## 1. What is Context Engineering?

**Context Engineering** is the practice of structuring information so AI assistants can work effectively on a codebase without re-reading the world every session. Instead of letting the agent crawl the whole repo on every prompt (expensive, slow, lossy), the repo curates _what_ the agent sees, _when_ it sees it, and _why_.

This repo applies Context Engineering as a first-class architectural concern. Every directory, naming convention, and skill exists to support one of three goals: keep the main conversation lean, route the agent to the right artifact for the task, and persist decisions so they survive sessions and compactions.

### Core Principles

| Principle                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Token Efficiency**       | Load only what the current task needs                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Progressive Loading**    | Start with a summary; pull details on demand                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Context Relevance**      | Different tasks need different context — match scope to need                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Single Source of Truth** | One place per fact (project values, Jira fields, branching strategy, etc.)                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Skills over prompts**    | Executable workflows live in `.agents/skills/`, never as copy-paste files                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Tool-agnostic context**  | `.agents/` holds the shared substrate (instructions, skills, hook emitter) consumed by every supported harness. `.claude/`, `.opencode/` and `.codex/` hold only thin adapters and generated artifacts, never a second copy of the content |

### The `.context/` vs `.agents/skills/` split

This is the load-bearing distinction in the repo. They look adjacent but serve opposite roles:

| Directory                                   | Contains                                                            | When loaded                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.context/`                                 | Facts about the system (what exists, how it works)                  | When the AI needs to understand the system                    |
| `.agents/skills/`                           | Workflow instructions (what to do, step by step)                    | Auto-triggered on intent by every harness                     |
| `.agents/` (rest)                           | Variable resolution + Jira manifest + hook emitter                  | Read by linters, skills and the harness adapters at runtime   |
| `docs/`                                     | Learning material for humans                                        | When humans need to learn                                     |
| `AGENTS.md`                                 | Always-on core of the operational rules + the router                | Every session, automatically, on every supported harness      |
| `.agents/instructions/`                     | One file per instruction section (git, PBI, tools, variables, ...)  | On demand, when the router or a hook `ROUTE:` line names it   |

### 2.1 Host harnesses: one source, three consumers

The repo runs on **Claude Code, OpenCode, and Codex (CLI + Desktop)**. There is exactly one copy of every instruction and every skill. Where the harnesses genuinely differ (MCP file format, hook API, whether slash commands exist at all) each keeps a thin versioned adapter. Nothing is duplicated.

> Visual walkthrough: [**Una fuente, tres harnesses**](https://upex-galaxy.github.io/agentic-dev-boilerplate/harnesses.es.html) (Spanish, published page with diagrams; source `packages/pages-home/harnesses.es.html`), one page of the [docs hub](https://upex-galaxy.github.io/agentic-dev-boilerplate/). Decision record: [`ADR-0002`](.context/ADR/ADR-0002-multi-harness-single-source.md).

| Surface          | Claude Code                                     | OpenCode                                    | Codex CLI + Desktop                      |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Instructions** | `CLAUDE.md` → `@AGENTS.md` **[generated shim]** | `AGENTS.md` (native)                        | `AGENTS.md` (native)                     |
| **Instruction sections** | `.agents/instructions/` (on demand, via the L0 router) | `.agents/instructions/` (on demand)   | `.agents/instructions/` (on demand)      |
| **Skills**       | `.claude/skills` **[generated alias]**          | `.agents/skills/` (native)                  | `.agents/skills/` (native)               |
| **Commands**     | none: `/<skill> <mode>` (the skill slash)       | none: skill + mode in prose                 | none: skill + mode in prose              |
| **Hook**         | `.claude/settings.json` → `UserPromptSubmit`    | `.opencode/plugins/personality-reinject.js` | `.codex/hooks.json` → `UserPromptSubmit` |
| **MCP**          | `.mcp.json`                                     | `opencode.jsonc`                            | `.codex/config.toml`                     |

**Instructions.** The instructions load in layers, progressive disclosure ([ADR-0009](.context/ADR/ADR-0009-progressive-disclosure-of-instructions.md)). `AGENTS.md` is the always-on core (L0): the binding sentence of each Critical Rule, the behavioural layer, the orchestration core, the LOAD PROTOCOL and a fixed router table. Each topic lives in one file under `.agents/instructions/` (L1), read on demand when the router or a hook `ROUTE:` line names it; a rule only this project has goes in `.agents/instructions/project.md`, and so does the router row of a skill the project created for itself (its "Project context skills" table, which the hook reads next to the router), because `bun run up` never touches that file. L0 also imports `package.json` and `.agents/project.yaml` for Claude Code (bare `@` tokens in their router rows); OpenCode and Codex follow the rows' reinforced instruction to read them. OpenCode and Codex load `AGENTS.md` natively. Claude Code loads `CLAUDE.md`, which is exactly `@AGENTS.md` plus one newline: a documented import rather than a symlink, so it survives a Windows checkout. Writing operational prose into `CLAUDE.md` is structural drift, and `agents:compat:check` fails on it.

**Skills.** Every repo skill lives committed under `.agents/skills/`, and project-level community skills install into the same store. OpenCode and Codex discover that directory natively. Claude Code reaches the same tree through `.claude/skills`, a POSIX symlink (Windows junction) that is **generated and gitignored**: never committed, never hand-edited.

**Commands.** None ship ([ADR-0006](.context/ADR/ADR-0006-skill-plus-mode-invocation.md)): a skill is invoked by its own name plus a mode on every harness (`/project-context data` on Claude Code, in prose on OpenCode and Codex). A project may keep its own command files under `.claude/commands/` or `.opencode/commands/`; one named like a skill hides the skill's instructions, so the compatibility check fails on it and `bun run agents:compat` moves it to `.backups/shadowing-commands/`.

**Hook.** `.agents/hooks/personality-reinject.mjs` holds the output contract and the `AGENT IDENTITY:` line (the source of the `Worktree:` / `Session:` commit trailers) once, and emits one `ROUTE: read <file>` line per instruction file the prompt needs and the session has not been routed to yet (classified with the L0 router and each section's `triggers:`). Claude Code and Codex run it as a `UserPromptSubmit` command hook (the Codex adapter ships a POSIX and a PowerShell command) and on `SessionStart` with the `compact` and `clear` matchers to re-arm the routes; OpenCode imports the same lines from a thin plugin. The contract is enforced by `cli/lib/agent-compatibility-contracts.ts`: no absolute personal paths, no duplicated hook file.

**MCP.** The canonical server set is whatever `.mcp.json` declares (local servers only; web search runs at harness level); every server there must exist in the other two configs. Parity is checked semantically: each native format (JSON / JSONC / TOML) is normalized into a common shape and compared on the `.env` variables each server depends on, so a server missing from one host, or present in one host only, is a failure. The four boilerplate-known ids additionally get a strict per-host shape check when the project declares them; any other server gets the generic check only. Codex cannot expand `${VAR}` inside `args`, so `.codex/config.toml` passes `supabase` env-only auth.

**Generated versus versioned (hard rule, `AGENTS.md` Critical Rule #15).** Every bold `[generated]` cell above is output. Edit the source, then regenerate:

| Generated artifact                                  | Its source                                   | Regenerate              |
| --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `CLAUDE.md` (one-line `@AGENTS.md` shim)            | `AGENTS.md`                                  | `bun run agents:compat` |
| `.claude/skills` (POSIX symlink / Windows junction) | `.agents/skills/`                            | `bun run agents:compat` |

`bun run agents:compat:check` validates the whole contract (shim bytes, alias target, no command named like a skill, hook adapters, MCP parity, eslint block wiring). It runs inside `bun run repo:check`, unconditionally in the pre-push hook, and in pre-commit when a harness surface is staged.

**The updater.** `bun run up` never generates or syncs a command file, removes the ones the retired alias layer generated, and names a leftover `.agents/compatibility/command-aliases.project.json` once as an informational row. It closes with one "Estado por superficie" table (one row per surface, `SURFACE_ORDER` in `cli/lib/updater-parity.ts`) and ONE parity prompt saved to `.agents/prompts/parity-plan.md`: numbered rows with evidence, one per path, each awaiting `keep project | take upstream | merge` before the AI edits anything; `take upstream` is suggested only where the project lacks the content entirely. `--strict` turns compat errors or blocking findings into exit 1; an aborted run prints `Abortado.` and exits 1; `.claude/settings.json` ships once when missing and then sits on the protected watchlist, never overwritten. On the migration run the `.claude/skills` alias waits for the migration commit (`bun run agents:compat` creates it). The watchlist also holds `.husky/pre-commit` and `.husky/pre-push` plus whatever a project lists under `updater.protected_paths` in `.agents/project.yaml` (never overwritten, delivered once when missing, drift row per upstream change); every `merge` row on a watched file says what to port and what to keep, and the identity files (`project.yaml`, `jira-required.yaml`) compare structure only (`informational` rows).

**Harness-specific facts worth knowing.** Codex loads project `.codex/` config and hooks only in a repository marked trusted, and `bun run setup:doctor` reports that trust as WARN because it is runtime state no file read can verify. Codex Desktop consumes the same repository config as the CLI: no second convention, no extra directory. Engram and caveman are Claude Code plugins; the rules that mention them are no-ops on a host where the plugin is absent. Every agent commit, on every harness, ends with the `Worktree:` + `Session:` trailers copied from the hook's `AGENT IDENTITY:` line; harness-branded trailers such as `Claude-Session:` are forbidden (ADR-0004).

## 3. Stable File Names (Reference With Confidence)

These files have stable names and locations. Any skill, command, or doc can reference them confidently:

### Skill modes

A multi-mode skill lists its modes in its own `## Mode routing` section; the first word after the skill name picks the mode (`/jira-administration components`, `/project-context dev-roadmap`). The former command names (`business-data-map`, `master-implementation-plan`, `jira-components`, ...) survive as trigger phrases. Keeping docs in step with a change is the docs follow-through (`.agents/skills/agentic-dev-core/references/docs-follow-through.md`) plus `bun run docs:check`, not a skill.

## 4. Workflow Overview

The repo composes work into three layers, in order of how often each runs:

### One-Time Setup (Foundation)

```
/project-foundation   → Constitution + PRD + SRS + Discovery outputs
/design-system        → DESIGN.md (visual identity, before frontend scaffolding)
/project-bootstrap    → Backend + frontend skeleton + OpenAPI + auth + env
/testability-guide    → /qa page + credentials artifact (after infra is live; idempotent re-runs)
```

> Foundation files (`.agents/`, `scripts/`, `AGENTS.md`) ship with the boilerplate: a new project gets them from `bunx create-agentic-dev`, with no separate bootstrap step. The Claude Code alias (`.claude/skills`) is generated by `bun run setup` / `bun run agents:compat`, not cloned.

**Output:** Populated `.context/` directories, a `DESIGN.md` at the repo root, and a working dev infrastructure.

### One-Time Setup (Existing App)

An app that already exists skips the foundation chain above: nothing is scaffolded and no PRD or SRS is invented.

```
bunx create-agentic-dev --adopt   → installs the tooling, overwrites nothing the app owns, touches no database
/project-adoption                 → analysis (no writes) → plan → approval → identity + stack: + tracker + protected paths
/project-context refresh-all      → business maps from the code
/project-foundation (Discovery)   → dev guide + domain glossary
/git-flow-master Strategy Setup   → the app's real branches and rulesets
/design-system extract            → DESIGN.md from the live theme (optional)
/testability-guide                → /qa page + credentials artifact (optional)
```

`bun run bootstrap:guard` refuses the `/project-bootstrap` base phases on such a repo; its add-ons stay available and read the `stack:` block. Every skill reads the app's real stack from that block (`.agents/project.yaml`) instead of the greenfield defaults.

### Continuous Product Management

```
/product-management   → Seed backlog, add features, create epics, refine stories
                      → Workflow G: sprint reporting (epics/stories/PRs snapshot)
```

### Per-Story Dev Loop

```
/sprint-development           → Planning → Implementation → Code Review → Staging → (gated) Production
                        └── /unit-testing (composable, optional TDD slice)
/git-flow-master      → Branch, commit, push, PR, conflicts, chained-PR planning (auto-adapts to strategy)
```

### Meta-SDD (Spec-Driven Development) — for substantial changes

When a change is big enough that you'd want a written spec before coding, you can opt into the SDD bloque. **Not installed by `bun run setup`** — that runs `gentle-ai install --preset minimal` which provisions Engram only. To use SDD, install it separately at user-level (e.g. `gentle-ai install sdd` or via the agent's skill manager). Once installed, the `/sdd-*` commands become available:

```
/sdd-init       → Detect stack, bootstrap persistence backend
/sdd-explore    → Investigate an idea; no files yet
/sdd-new        → Start a new change (meta-command, orchestrator-handled)
/sdd-ff         → Fast-forward planning: proposal → spec → design → tasks
/sdd-apply      → Implement tasks, check off as you go
/sdd-verify     → Validate implementation against spec
/sdd-archive    → Close the change, persist final state
/sdd-continue   → Continue next dependency-ready phase
/sdd-onboard    → Guided end-to-end walkthrough
```

> **QA workflows** (sprint testing, exploratory testing, automation, regression) live in the sister repo [agentic-qa-boilerplate](https://github.com/upex-galaxy/agentic-qa-boilerplate). The two repos are a complementary pair.

## 6. Architectural Decisions (Why This Repo Works This Way)

These are non-obvious decisions baked into the structure. If you find yourself wanting to "improve" one, read the rationale first.

### Backend before Frontend (during `/project-bootstrap`)

Backend scaffolding runs **before** frontend scaffolding because the backend defines the schemas the frontend consumes. This is how a scaffolded project is born; an adopted app keeps its own type flow, and its import alias is `stack.conventions.import_alias`. The scaffold flow is:

```typescript
// 1. Backend defines schemas (project-bootstrap, step 1)
// schemas/user.ts
export const userSchema = z.object({
  id: z.string().uuid(),
  name: z.string(),
  email: z.string().email(),
});

// 2. Backend generates types automatically
export type User = z.infer<typeof userSchema>;

// 3. Frontend imports real types (project-bootstrap, step 2)
import type { User } from '@/lib/types';

const UserCard = ({ user }: { user: User }) => {
  return <div>{user.name}</div>; // zero type errors, no mocks
};
```

**Benefits:** zero type mismatches, frontend consumes real APIs not mocks, backend changes propagate to frontend automatically.

### Manual before Automated testing

Exploratory testing runs **before** test automation in the QA sister repo. The trade-off:

| Aspect      | Exploratory (manual) | Automation (E2E/integration) |
| ----------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Speed       | 5–30 minutes         | Hours/days to build          |
| Coverage    | UX + logic bugs      | Logic only                   |
| Investment  | Low                  | High                         |
| Flexibility | Total                | Rigid                        |

**Principle:** automate only what's already been validated manually. Don't pay the automation tax on functionality that's broken or about to change.

### Jira-First workflow

Tickets are **created in Jira first** (via `/acli` or MCP), and the real Jira ID drives the local artifact name (e.g. `.context/PBI/epics/EPIC-UPEX-200-<epic>/stories/STORY-UPEX-277-empty-states/`). No locally-invented IDs, no rename churn later, perfect 1:1 traceability between the repo and the tracker.

### Spec-Driven Development (SDD) for substantial changes

For changes big enough to need a written spec, the workflow is spec → design → tasks → apply → verify → archive. Each phase is a separate sub-agent with a fresh context window, persisting artifacts via engram (default) or `openspec/` files. The orchestrator never executes — it delegates.

### Orchestration model

The main conversation is a **command center**, not an executor. Sub-agents do the heavy reading, writing, and running. This keeps the main thread's context lean and lets each sub-agent specialize. The 7-component briefing format (`AGENTS.md` § Orchestration Mode) is the contract between orchestrator and sub-agent.

### One source, three harnesses

Instructions and skills exist exactly once (`AGENTS.md` with its sections under `.agents/instructions/`, and `.agents/skills/`); Claude Code, OpenCode and Codex each reach them through a generated shim, alias or native discovery, and only the surfaces where hosts genuinely differ (MCP format, hook API, slash-command existence) carry a thin adapter. The alternative, one copy per harness, was tried implicitly (the repo was Claude-only with `.claude/` as the source) and rejected because every duplicated instruction drifts. Rationale, alternatives and the migration path for older projects: [`ADR-0002`](.context/ADR/ADR-0002-multi-harness-single-source.md); wiring: §2.1 above.

### One generator per file under `.context/`

Every file under `.context/` is owned by either a manual editor, a script, or a skill. Files are never hand-edited if a generator exists. This is why `.context/README.md` maintains a "Who generates what" table — if you add a new artifact, add its generator.

**Exception — `.context/ADR/` (append-only, no generator).** Architecture Decision Records are the one `.context/` artifact that is **authored, never regenerated**. A human architect (or an AI workflow drafting for human approval — `/project-foundation` SRS phase, `/sprint-development` Stage 1) writes one per important, hard-to-reverse decision. They are append-only: superseded by a newer ADR that links back, never overwritten or deleted. Do not "re-run an owner" to refresh an ADR — supersede it. See `.context/ADR/README.md` for the when-to-write rule, status lifecycle, and template.

## 7. Operational Rules (DO's and DON'Ts)

Curated, repo-specific. The full list of generic rules lives in `AGENTS.md` (each rule's binding sentence) and `.agents/instructions/01-critical-rules.md` (full text) — this section is the short list of things that go wrong in practice.

### DO

1. **Run `bun run vars:check` after touching any prompt or skill** — validates every `{{VAR}}` and `{{jira.*}}` reference resolves against config.
2. **Read the data map (`bun run context:map business-data-context`) before planning a feature** — it's the cheapest way to avoid misunderstanding the domain.
3. **Reference values via `{{VAR_NAME}}` in prompts**, never hardcode URLs/keys/paths.
4. **Treat skills as the workflow source of truth** — if a workflow lives in a doc but not a skill, the doc is wrong.
5. **Save decisions to engram** as you make them (`mem_save`) — they survive sessions and compactions.
6. **Re-run a generator instead of hand-editing** any auto-generated file (e.g. `.agents/skills/REGISTRY.md`, the business maps inside the context skills, and every harness surface: `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/skills` via `bun run agents:compat`).
7. **Patch the docs in the change that moved the fact** — the docs follow-through (`agentic-dev-core/references/docs-follow-through.md`) keeps `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, `docs/` and the onboarding HTML in step; `bun run docs:check` proves the router, links and quoted scripts.
8. **Run `bun run agents:compat:check` after touching `AGENTS.md`, `.agents/`, `.claude/`, `.opencode/`, `.codex/` or an MCP config** — it is the gate pre-push runs anyway; failing it early is cheaper.

### DON'T

1. **Don't try to invoke `/agentic-dev-core`** — it's a passive reference host, not an invokable command. Foundation files ship with the cloned repo.
2. **Don't create new files under `.context/` without a generator** — they will drift and rot. Add the generator first.
3. **Don't hand-edit `.agents/jira-fields.json` or `.agents/skills/REGISTRY.md`** — both are regenerated by scripts.
4. **Don't load PRD/SRS for simple per-story work** — module-level context is usually enough.
5. **Don't bypass the orchestration model** — main-thread reads of 4+ files are a smell. Delegate.
6. **Don't include AI attribution in commits** (`Co-Authored-By: Claude`, etc.) — commits must look human-authored.
7. **Don't push to `main` without explicit user confirmation.**
8. **Don't conflate `.context/` (facts) with `.agents/skills/` (workflows)** — adding a workflow under `.context/` will not auto-trigger.
9. **Don't write prose into `CLAUDE.md` or name a command like a skill** — `CLAUDE.md` is the `@AGENTS.md` shim, `.claude/skills` is an alias, and a command with a skill's name hides that skill. Edit the source and run `bun run agents:compat` (`AGENTS.md` Critical Rule #15).
