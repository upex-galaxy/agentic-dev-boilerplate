# `.context/business/` — Single Source of Business Knowledge

The authored "understand the business" files live here. Two layers:

1. **Constitution** — why the product exists (industry, segments, competition).
   Output of `/project-foundation` Phase 1.
2. **Maps** — how the product is built (entities, features, API journeys).
   Output of `/project-foundation` Phase 4 through `/project-context data` / `features` / `api`.
   They live as HTML maps inside the `business-data-context`, `business-feature-context` and
   `business-api-context` skills, not in this folder; read one with `bun run context:map <slug>`.

## When to refresh

- Constitution files (`business-model.md` / `market-context.md` / `legacy-analysis.md`):
  major product pivot, new MVP cut, market repositioning. Otherwise once-and-done.
- Maps + dev guide: re-run the matching `/project-context <mode>` (maps) or `/project-foundation` step (dev guide) after architecture changes.

## Skill references that drive generation

- `.agents/skills/project-foundation/references/constitution-business-model.md`
- `.agents/skills/project-foundation/references/constitution-market-context.md`
- `.agents/skills/project-context/references/data.md` · `features.md` · `api.md` (modes of the `project-context` skill, invoked as `/project-context <mode>`)
