This file is the per-session compact-rules cache for the Skill Resolver protocol.
The orchestrator copies one or more `## Skill: <slug>` blocks below into every subagent briefing under `## Project Standards (auto-resolved)`.
Subagents trust those compact rules and only read the full SKILL.md when explicitly instructed.

## Skill: acli

**Purpose**: Atlassian CLI (official `acli` binary, v1.3+ as of 2026) for Jira Cloud, Confluence Cloud, and org admin tasks from the terminal.

**Compact Rules**:
- **Silent pagination truncation.** `workitem search` without `--paginate` returns the first page only — no warning. Scripts that count or iterate keys read the wrong number of items.
- **Auth is per-product.** `acli jira auth login` does not authenticate `acli admin`, `acli confluence`, or `acli rovodev`. There is also a top-level `acli auth` for global OAuth (newer surface). Each scope has its own session.
- **The "work item" vs "issue" split.** The CLI renamed commands (`jira issue` → `jira workitem`) but the JSON response still has a top-level `issues[]` array and CSV inputs still use `issueType`/`parentIssueId` spellings. Mixing old and new terminology in the same script works, but confuses readers.
- **Unknown subcommands fail silently.** Typing `acli jira workflow --help` does NOT error — it falls back to `acli jira --help` with exit 0. So "no error" ≠ "command exists". Always verify by checking the help body actually changed.
- **Hard limits the docs do not advertise.** `acli` cannot list custom fields, edit custom-field values on existing items, manage workflows, manage issue types, or touch project versions/components. See `references/gotchas.md`.
- `acli` binary is not installed in the environment.
- `acli` auth fails and cannot be fixed in the current session.
- The operation is one of the documented `acli` blind spots: enumerate custom fields, edit custom-field values on existing work items, manage workflows / issue types / priorities / resolutions / project versions / components, upload attachments, add watchers, add an item to a sprint.
- Bulk operations (acli consumes far fewer tokens per call).
- Scripting / CI pipelines.
- Operations that return large result sets (MCP payloads inflate token usage).
- `-y, --yes` — skip the interactive confirmation prompt. Required in CI; if omitted the command hangs waiting on stdin. **Note:** this flag does NOT exist on `admin user delete` / `admin user cancel-delete` (use `--ignore-errors` there instead).
- `--ignore-errors` — do not abort the batch when a single item fails.
- default table (human-readable)
- `--json` (for `jq` / scripts)
- (truncated — read full SKILL.md for the rest)

**Read full SKILL.md when**: the compact rules above are insufficient (e.g. novel scenario, debugging, or the briefing tells you to load the full skill).

## Skill: agentic-dev-core

**Purpose**: Foundation skill that (a) hosts shared references cited by all workflow skills (briefing template, dispatch patterns, orchestration doctr...

**Compact Rules**:
- **Passive — shared reference library.** Workflow skills (`sprint-development`, `unit-testing`, `project-foundation`, `project-bootstrap`, `product-management`) cite files under `references/` instead of duplicating the same briefing template, dispatch patterns and orchestration doctrine inside every skill. Loading a workflow skill therefore implies loading the relevant `agentic-dev-core/references/*.md` on demand.
- **Active — bootstrap trigger.** When users adopt this boilerplate by downloading skills à la carte (e.g. cloning `.claude/skills/sprint-development/` only), they end up missing the foundation files those skills depend on (`CLAUDE.md`, `.agents/project.yaml`, `scripts/agents-*.ts`, etc.). Invoking `/agentic-dev-core` regenerates that foundation from the templates shipped under `templates/`.
- **`.agents/project.yaml`** — template variable source. Skills resolve `{{VAR}}` against this. Nothing depends on it yet at this point in the install, so write it first.
- **`.agents/jira-required.yaml`** — manifest of Jira custom fields AND `work_types:` (issue types + canonical statuses + canonical transitions) the methodology requires. Read by `scripts/check-jira-setup.ts`, `scripts/sync-jira-workflows.ts`, and `scripts/agents-lint.ts`.
- **`.agents/jira-fields.json`** — empty stub (`{}`). Real catalog is written later by `bun run jira:sync-fields`. Documented in `templates/jira-fields.json.template` so the file exists from minute zero.
- **`.agents/jira-workflows.json`** — empty shell with one entry per declared `work_type` (e.g. `{"story": {...}, "bug": {...}}` with `null`/`{}` placeholders). Real catalog is written later by `bun run jira:sync-workflows`. Documented in `templates/jira-workflows.json.template` so the file exists from minute zero.
- **`scripts/agents-setup.ts` + `scripts/agents-lint.ts` + `scripts/sync-jira-fields.ts` + `scripts/sync-jira-workflows.ts` + `scripts/check-jira-setup.ts`** — the five CLIs that operate on the four files above. Source files live as `templates/scripts/*.ts.template` (the `.template` suffix keeps them out of this repo's `tsconfig`/`eslint` scope, since they aren't live source code here); strip the `.template` suffix when writing to the destination `scripts/` directory. Order within this group does not matter.
- **`package.json`** (penultimate) — merged: declared `dependencies` and `scripts` from `templates/package.json.partial.json` are added to the existing `package.json` if one exists; otherwise the partial is the seed for a fresh `package.json`. **Mandatory step:** without this merge, none of the five scripts written in step 5 are invocable via `bun run …`.
- **`CLAUDE.md`** (last). It cites every file written in steps 1-6, so it must be written after all of them. OpenCode reads `CLAUDE.md` as a fallback per its Claude Code compat docs, so a single canonical file covers both supported agents — no symlink needed.
- **`.context/_framework/testing-capabilities.json`** (post-bootstrap detection). After CLAUDE.md exist, run `bun scripts/detect-testing-capabilities.ts` to populate the testing-capabilities cache. The script inspects `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, ESLint configs, plus the strict-TDD priority chain (`<!-- strict_tdd: ... -->` marker in CLAUDE.md → `testing.strict_tdd` in `.agents/project.yaml` → runner-based fallback) and writes `.context/_framework/testing-capabilities.json`. Downstream skills (`unit-testing`, `sprint-development`) read this cache instead of re-detecting on every dispatch. Schema and detection algorithm: `references/testing-capabilities.md`.
- `bun run agents:setup` — fill `.agents/project.yaml` interactively.
- `bun run jira:sync-fields` — populate `.agents/jira-fields.json` from their Jira workspace.
- `bun run jira:sync-workflows` — populate `.agents/jira-workflows.json` from their Jira workspace (interactive on first run for canonical slugs that don't auto-resolve to a workflow's real status / transition names).
- `bun run jira:check` — validate that BOTH catalogs satisfy the manifest (custom fields + `work_types`).
- `bun run lint:agents` — confirm every project-variable and Jira reference (custom fields, work types, statuses, transitions) resolves.
- (truncated — read full SKILL.md for the rest)

## Skill: agentic-dev-onboard

**Purpose**: Walks new users through this repo's dev flow — Next.js + Supabase stack, Jira workflow (Ready For Dev → In Progress → In Review → Ready F...

**Compact Rules**:
- Use **Context7** for "how to use X" — official docs, current API
- Use **Tavily** for "how to solve X" — community fixes, troubleshooting
- [ ] Did you run `bun run setup`?
- [ ] Did you fill `.env` with your own credentials (`LOCAL_*`, `STAGING_*`, `ATLASSIAN_*`, `TAVILY_API_KEY`, `SUPABASE_*`)?
- [ ] Does `bun run lint:agents` exit clean (0 errors)?
- [ ] Do the gentle-ai skills appear in autocomplete (restart your agent if not)?
- [ ] Ready for your first ticket: `/sprint-development <UPEX-XXX>`
- Implement features → use `/sprint-development`
- Write unit tests → use `/unit-testing`
- Refine acceptance criteria → use `/product-management`
- Define a brand-new product → use `/project-foundation`
- Scaffold backend / frontend code → use `/project-bootstrap`

## Skill: design-system

**Purpose**: Genera un DESIGN.md (formato Google Labs Apache-2.0) en el root del proyecto antes del scaffolding del frontend.

**Compact Rules**:
- `agentic-dev-core/references/briefing-template.md` — used when dispatching to a subagent (Open Design or Claude Design handoff conversion).
- `agentic-dev-core/references/dispatch-patterns.md` — selects Single / Sequential / Parallel for the chosen path.
- `.context/idea/business-model.md` — industria, value-prop, tone implícito.
- `.context/PRD/personas.md` — target visual, demographic signal.
- `.context/PRD/executive-summary.md` — positioning, success KPIs.
- A new project just finished the PRD and needs to define visual identity before the SRS architecture phase.
- An existing project wants to rebrand without touching Constitution / PRD / code.
- A team wants to centralize design tokens in a portable format consumable by multiple AI agents.
- Implement UI / components — that's `/sprint-development` + community skill `frontend-design`.
- Define PRD or personas — that's `/project-foundation` phases 2.x.
- Scaffold the frontend code (Tailwind install, page skeletons, shadcn setup) — that's `/project-bootstrap` frontend-setup.
- Tweak existing tokens after scaffolding — edit `DESIGN.md` directly and re-run the bootstrap pre-flight.
- **`DESIGN.md`** at the project root (path configurable via `design_md_path` in `.agents/project.yaml`, default `./DESIGN.md`).
- Format: Apache-2.0 spec from Google Labs (`google-labs-code/design.md`). YAML frontmatter with design tokens + markdown prose with rationale.
- Eight prescribed sections (order matters, sections may be omitted but never reordered): Overview → Colors → Typography → Layout → Elevation & Depth → Shapes → Components → Do's and Don'ts.

## Skill: git-flow-master

**Purpose**: End-to-end Git operator for any branching strategy.

**Compact Rules**:
- "I want to start work on UPEX-123" → branch creation
- "commit and push", "subir cambios", "push to main" → commit + push flow
- "abrí un PR contra staging" → PR creation
- "tengo conflictos al hacer pull" → conflict resolution
- "este PR va a quedar enorme" → chained-PR planning hand-off
- "qué estrategia de git usamos en este repo" → strategy detection / persistence
- "el push fue rechazado" → diagnostic + recovery flow
- Current branch.
- Dirty / clean working tree (staged / unstaged / untracked counts).
- Unpushed / unpulled commits (ahead / behind upstream).
- Upstream status (no upstream, up-to-date, diverged).
- Remote name(s) — most repos have one (`origin`); some have a fork + upstream.
- **Marker in `CLAUDE.md`** — search for `<!-- git-flow-master:strategy:VALUE -->` where `VALUE` is one of the seven slugs. If found, use it. This is the persisted decision.
- **Single-branch heuristic** — `git branch -a` shows only `main` (or `master`) and no integration branch in the remote → `solo-main`.
- **Two-branch heuristic** — exactly `main` (or `master`) + one of `{staging, dev, develop, integration}` exists upstream → `main-integration` (record the integration branch name).

## Skill: product-management

**Purpose**: Orchestrates continuous product management work — initial backlog seed from PRD, incremental feature addition, epic creation, story refin...

**Compact Rules**:
- A new feature or epic needs to be added to the backlog
- A story has rough or ambiguous acceptance criteria that need sharpening
- A story needs INVEST validation or a 3-amigos session before development starts
- You're systematically enumerating edge cases / failure modes for a feature
- You're seeding the very first product backlog from a freshly minted PRD
- `/project-foundation` should have produced `.context/PRD/` and `.context/SRS/` (required for the initial backlog-seed workflow; useful context for all others)
- `.agents/project.yaml` populated with `{{PROJECT_KEY}}`, `{{ISSUE_TRACKER}}`, `{{JIRA_URL}}` — run `/agentic-dev-core` if missing
- Atlassian / Jira tooling reachable (Atlassian CLI `acli` preferred, MCP Atlassian as fallback) for any workflow that writes to Jira
- **Source-of-truth specs** at `.context/PBI/specs/{capability}/{feature}.md` (canonical, always-current behavior — RFC 2119 + Gherkin)
- **Delta specs** per change at `.context/PBI/{ticket}/spec.md` with explicit `## ADDED Requirements`, `## MODIFIED Requirements`, and `## REMOVED Requirements` sections
- **Archive process** that merges deltas back into the source-of-truth on story close and moves the change folder under `.context/PBI/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-{ticket}/`
- **Per-story implementation** → `/sprint-development` (planning → code → review → deploy loop)
- **TDD on a single function** → `/unit-testing` (composable inside `/sprint-development`)
- **Formal QA test cases, exploratory testing, automation, regression** → out of scope here; see the sister boilerplate `agentic-qa-boilerplate` for `sprint-testing`, `test-documentation`, `test-automation`, and related QA workflows
- `{{PROJECT_KEY}}` — Jira project key (e.g., `MYM`, `UPEX`)
- (truncated — read full SKILL.md for the rest)

## Skill: project-bootstrap

**Purpose**: Scaffolds the technical infrastructure of a new project: backend (DB schemas, API base, types, error handling), frontend (design system,...

**Compact Rules**:
- `agentic-dev-core/references/briefing-template.md` — used when dispatching parallel scaffolding subagents (e.g. backend + frontend in parallel).
- `agentic-dev-core/references/dispatch-patterns.md` — picks Single / Sequential / Parallel for each phase below.
- A fresh repo has its product foundation (`/project-foundation` already ran) but no code yet.
- An existing repo needs an incremental infrastructure feature added (e.g. "add OpenAPI to the API", "add bearer auth", "wire Supabase types into the frontend").
- Define the product (PRD, user journeys, architecture decisions) — that's `/project-foundation`.
- Seed the Jira backlog with epics + user stories — that's `/product-management`.
- Implement an individual user story (planning → code → review → deploy) — that's `/sprint-development`.
- Set up a unit-test framework — that's `/unit-testing` (and is its own concern).
- **OpenAPI integration** → `references/openapi-setup.md`. Schema generation, Swagger / Scalar UI, contract publication.
- **API routes + middleware** → `references/api-routes-setup.md`. Route conventions, error responses, request logging, auth middleware wiring.
- **Bearer-token auth** → `references/bearer-token-support.md`. JWT issuance, refresh tokens, protected-route middleware, session handling.
- **Env vars + URL builders** → `references/env-url-setup.md`. Typed `.env` schema, environment-aware URL helpers, validation at boot.
- **Supabase types generation** → `references/supabase-types-setup.md`. DB schema → TypeScript types pipeline, regeneration script, frontend wiring.
- After base backend exists → `openapi-setup`, `api-routes-setup`, `bearer-token-support`, `env-url-setup` can each run in their own subagent.
- After base frontend exists → `supabase-types-setup` wires backend types into the frontend.

## Skill: project-foundation

**Purpose**: Orchestrates the foundational definition of a new product/project: Constitution (business model + market context), Architecture (PRD + SR...

**Compact Rules**:
- `agentic-dev-core/references/briefing-template.md` — used when dispatching subagents to research market data, audit competitors, or interview users.
- `agentic-dev-core/references/dispatch-patterns.md` — picks Single / Sequential / Parallel for each phase below.
- A new product/project is being defined from scratch and you need Constitution + PRD + SRS + Discovery artifacts.
- An existing project needs to redefine scope significantly (e.g. pivot, new MVP cut) and the foundation docs must be regenerated.
- A specific section is missing or stale (e.g. user journeys haven't been written yet) — invoke just that phase via the Specific tasks table below.
- Scaffold the codebase (backend / frontend / OpenAPI / auth) — that's `/project-bootstrap`.
- Seed the Jira backlog with epics + stories — that's `/product-management`.
- Plan or implement an individual user story — that's `/sprint-development`.
- Set up unit tests — that's `/unit-testing`.
- Run QA workflows (test plans, exploratory testing, automation) — out of scope, see the sister `agentic-qa-boilerplate`.
- Read `references/constitution-business-model.md` for the canvas template (problem, solution, value prop, customer segments, channels, revenue model, cost structure, key metrics).
- Read `references/constitution-market-context.md` for industry positioning, competitive analysis, and trends.
- Read `references/prd-executive-summary.md` for problem statement, solution overview, success KPIs, MVP success metrics.
- Read `references/prd-personas.md` for target users, demographics, jobs-to-be-done, pain points.
- Read `references/prd-mvp-scope.md` for epic breakdown, must-have / should-have / could-have user stories, MVP cut.

## Skill: sprint-development

**Purpose**: Orchestrates the per-story dev loop end-to-end: Planning -> Implementation -> Code Review -> Staging deploy -> (gated) Production deploy.

**Compact Rules**:
- **New user story** (most common) -> Stage 1 (story-plan) -> Stage 2 (implement-story) -> ... -> Stage 4
- **New feature with multiple stories** -> Stage 1 macro (feature-plan) -> loop Stage 1+2 per story -> Stage 4 per merge
- **Bug fix** -> skip to Stage 2 with `bug-fix-workflow.md` (root cause first), then Stage 3+4
- **Resume from interruption** -> Stage 2 entry via `continue-implementation.md`
- **PR feedback / code review iteration** -> Stage 3 with `fix-issues.md`, fix-and-iterate loop
- **Production deploy** (separate event) -> Stage 5, only after QA green + business approval
- `.agents/project.yaml` populated. If missing, run `/agentic-dev-core` first.
- Story exists in the issue tracker with refined Acceptance Criteria. If backlog is empty or AC are unclear, run `/product-management` first.
- Branch policy clear and CI configured. First-time-only setup lives in `references/setup-linting.md` and `references/ci-cd-setup.md`.
- Working directory is the **target project repo**. Sprint-dev runs there, not in the boilerplate.
- `.env` populated with environment URLs and credentials. Never hardcode credentials.
- `references/feature-plan.md` — macro plan (epic-level, multiple stories)
- `references/story-plan.md` — micro plan (single story, recommended starting point)
- `references/spec-driven-development.md` — TDD-friendly philosophy: AC -> spec -> code
- **New story** -> `references/implement-story.md` (main flow). Walk the impl plan step-by-step.

## Skill: unit-testing

**Purpose**: Focused skill for unit-test design — TDD workflow (red-green-refactor), test naming (AAA, Given-When-Then), mocking patterns (mocks/spies...

**Compact Rules**:
- "Write unit tests for this function/class"
- "TDD this slice" / "red-green-refactor"
- "What should I mock here?"
- "How do I name this test?"
- "What's the right coverage target for this module?"
- Mid-flight from `/sprint-development` Stage 2 (Implementation) when implementing TDD-friendly code (pure functions, complex branching, bug fix reproducers)
- Project has a unit test runner configured (Jest, Vitest, Mocha, or similar)
- Test command exists in `package.json` (`bun test`, `npm test`, `vitest`, etc.)
- For TDD: test runner supports watch mode (`--watch`)
- If no runner is configured, the first task is to set one up — see `references/unit-testing.md` § Setup
- Identify the unit (function, class, module) — confirm with the user if ambiguous
- Decide TDD or after-the-fact (see `references/tdd-workflow.md`)
- Write tests using the project's naming convention (see `references/test-naming.md`)
- Mock external deps cleanly (see `references/mocking-patterns.md`)
- Run tests, confirm green
