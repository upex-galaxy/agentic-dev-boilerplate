## Context

The boilerplate's committed prose (`AGENTS.md`, `.agents/**`, `docs/**`, `README.md`, the decks) carries facts whose truth depends on the current contents of another file, of the tracker or of an external tool: counted rosters, enumerations copied from the file that owns them, a ruleset reading stamped with the day it was taken, and an updater paragraph in `AGENTS.md` §5.5 written as a changelog ("Since 8.2 / 8.3 / 8.4"). Each one is correct the day it is written and wrong a few weeks later, and an agent reads all of them every session with no way to tell the two states apart.

Some of those dated notes are the only inline record of WHY a rule exists. Deleting them loses the argument; keeping them in doctrine makes the rule carry a date that reads as a claim about the present and invites re-verification on every read.

Critical Rule #17 (`AGENTS.md` §1) and its canon (`.agents/skills/agentic-dev-core/references/volatile-facts.md`) settle the general case: committed prose names the source of truth, never its current value. This ADR settles the forensic-note case and is the record the prose points at. The sibling `agentic-qa-boilerplate` took the same decision first (its ADR-0006); this is the port.

## Decision

We will keep the WHY of a rule in the doctrine as one sentence with no figure and no date, and move the figure, the date and the context of every measurement that motivated a rule into a dated record: the §Ledger below for the boilerplate's own doctrine, `CHANGELOG.md` for release-by-release behaviour of the CLI, or a dated ledger a skill owns by design. The doctrine links the record instead of restating the number.

A new measurement that motivates a rule is appended to §Ledger, never inlined in the rule. ADRs, changelogs and dated reports are exempt from Rule #17 because the date is part of the claim; both linters skip `.context/ADR/` by path.

The two regex-visible families (`FILE-LINE`, `CURRENT-STATE`) are reported by `scripts/lint-skills.ts` and `scripts/lint-docs.ts` (`bun run docs:check`) at WARN while the existing prose is swept, and flip to ERROR when the sweep leaves no residue.

### Ledger of measurements behind current doctrine

Every row is a snapshot at its date. None of them is a claim about the present.

| Doctrine that keeps the why | Measurement (figure, date, context) |
|---|---|
| `AGENTS.md` Rule #9, MCP credential failure is silent on every host but Codex | Measured 2026-09-20 on all three hosts in `agentic-qa-boilerplate` (its ADR-0006): Claude Code passes an unset `${VAR}` through literally and the server dies on its first authenticated call, OpenCode substitutes an empty string, Codex fails loudly naming the server. It corrected the rule's earlier claim that a missing variable fails at parse time; the wording was ported here in the dev-sync doctrine pack (PR #35). |
| `AGENTS.md` §5.5 UPDATER END-OF-RUN, behaviours formerly narrated as "Since 8.2 / 8.3 / 8.4" | Release history of `bun run up`, recorded per release under `CHANGELOG.md` → `[Unreleased]` → the "Fixed (updater 8.1 …)" through "Fixed (updater 8.4)" sections (documented in `AGENTS.md` on 2026-09-04 and 2026-09-05). 8.1 introduced the env signal a self-update sends, which the `cli` cursor advance keys on; 8.2 put `.husky/pre-commit` and `.husky/pre-push` on the protected watchlist, added `updater.protected_paths`, the port-and-keep advice on a watched-file `merge` row and the structure-only compare of `.agents/project.yaml` / `.agents/jira-required.yaml`; 8.3 narrowed the dirty-tree guard to what the sync writes, collapsed a git-tracked `.context/PBI/` cache into one Componentes row with a saved recipe, seeded the marker of a newly protected path silently, advanced the `cli` cursor after a self-update and named the differing fields in MCP registry rows; 8.4 advanced the cursor after a self-update from a pre-8.1 parent by content comparison, made the heading compare punctuation-insensitive, reran `bun run skills:registry` as the last afterApply hook, seeded an unchanged watched file silently and printed the `Gates: omitidas` line. |
| `AGENTS.md` § Git Strategy, the accepted `main` divergence (ruleset requires a review, the maintainer pushes directly) | Verified 2026-08-21 against GitHub ruleset 16809536 on `main`: one approving review required; the classic `branches/main/protection` endpoint returned `404`, so only `rules/branches/main` revealed it. Divergence `main.direct_push_to_protected` accepted the same day (`policy.accepted_divergences` in `.agents/project.yaml`). |
| `.agents/skills/acli/SKILL.md` → "Size budget" (T5), and the publish steps of `sprint-development/references/feature-plan.md` / `story-plan.md`: measure the serialized ADF against 30,000 before writing a rich-text value | Vendor facts: Jira Cloud caps a rich-text value at 32,767 characters, not configurable on Cloud (JRACLOUD-59124, JRACLOUD-72176; `CONTENT_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` on REST v3, JRACLOUD-78553), and the cap counts the serialized ADF JSON, not the visible text (JRACLOUD-95408). Measured 2026-09-30 in `agentic-qa-boilerplate` (its ADR-0007): a real 32,389-character Markdown plan became 71,209 characters of ADF JSON through `md-to-adf.ts` (ratio 2.2). Measured here 2026-10-02 with the same converter (`jq -c . \| wc -m`): the plan-body skeleton of the `feature-plan.md` template, unfilled, is 13,615 Markdown characters and 55,525 of ADF; the `story-plan.md` skeleton is 12,941 and 55,233 (ratio about 4.1-4.3, the templates being tables and nested lists). A plan that keeps every template section is over the cap before any content is written, which is why the budget step also says that sections that do not apply are omitted. |
| `sprint-development/references/feature-plan.md` / `story-plan.md`: authoring rules sit outside the published body, the body is the block between the `plan-body` markers, and `scripts/plan-templates-adf-budget.test.ts` keeps each unfilled body under half the 32,767 cap | Measured 2026-10-02 with `md-to-adf.ts` (`jq -c . \| wc -m`). Before the reshape the bodies were 55,525 (feature) and 55,233 (story) ADF characters unfilled. After: 10,095 (feature, 1,755 Markdown characters) and 10,743 (story, 1,629). A realistic filled plan written to the new skeleton measured 14,383 (feature: four stories, four decisions) and 18,683 (story: five steps, full UI section). Two costs dominate: bold list labels (about 14% of a filled plan) and the converter emitting a separate text node at every `:`, `[`, `_` and `~` (merging adjacent text nodes with the same marks would save about 17% on a filled plan and about 40% on a skeleton full of `[placeholders]`). |
| `sprint-development/references/live-ui-validation.md` §3, browser sessions: named in-memory sessions, `--raw fill`, never `--persistent` / `--profile`, never `close-all` / `kill-all`, namespace per `.playwright/` folder | Measured on `playwright-cli` 0.1.14 (playwright-core 1.61.0-alpha) 2026-09-30 and 2026-10-01 in `agentic-qa-boilerplate` (its ADR-0008): a config with `isolated: false` + `userDataDir` made every session name share one profile; without them each named session is in memory (`userDataDir: null, persistent: false`); the namespace is the nearest ancestor holding `.playwright/`; `kill-all` SIGKILLs every Playwright CLI daemon and MCP server on the machine without flushing cookies; `cookie-list` / `cookie-get` print values; `state-save` writes mode `0644` and, with no filename, `storage-state-<timestamp>.json` into the current directory. Re-measured here 2026-10-02 against this repo's shipped `.playwright/cli.config.json`, from a scratch directory: two named sessions both listed `userDataDir: null, persistent: false, headed: false`; `fill <ref> "$VAR"` printed the value once in its output, `--raw fill` printed nothing. |

## Consequences

- **Positive:** doctrine reads as a contract again: the rule, its one-sentence why, and a pointer. A session never has to decide whether a dated verification is still true; `bun run git:policy verify` and the CLI's own behaviour are the live answers. The lint can flag a dating word in doctrine without an allowlist per rule, because the dated form has one home.
- **Negative / trade-offs:** the reader who doubts a rule takes one more hop to see the evidence. A measurement appended here has to be linked from the doctrine by hand; nothing checks that the link exists. While the lints run at WARN, new residue can still land; the sweep that flips them to ERROR closes that window.
- **Neutral / follow-ups:** counts and enumerations have no regex shape and stay a review-time judgement (canon §7). The `AGENTS.md` §5 skill router is the one enumeration `docs:check` verifies, against the committed skills.

## Alternatives considered

- **Delete the forensic notes outright** — loses the only record of why several rules exist; the next session re-litigates a settled rule with no evidence.
- **Keep the dated notes in the doctrine** — the reader cannot tell a rationale from a live claim, and the lint cannot flag dating vocabulary without allowlisting every rule.
- **Only the CHANGELOG** — a changelog is ordered by release, not by rule; a reader starting from a rule would not find its measurement. It stays the home of release-by-release CLI behaviour, and the ledger row points into it.
- **Block (ERROR) from day one** — every unit working in parallel on prose would fail a gate on residue it did not write. Rejected by the owner in favour of warn first, sweep and block last.
