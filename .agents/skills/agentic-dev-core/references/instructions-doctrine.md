# Instructions doctrine: where does this sentence go?

> The one sanctioned path for changing what the agent is told on every session or per request kind: any change to `AGENTS.md`, a section under `.agents/instructions/`, the router or a `triggers:` list runs the procedure in §6, and every skill whose own flow writes a project fact into `agent-project.md` follows §4. Decision records: `.context/ADR/ADR-0009-progressive-disclosure-of-instructions.md` (the split) and `.context/ADR/ADR-0014-instructions-maintenance-locks.md` (what holds it in place). Folder guide: `.agents/instructions/README.md`.

## 1. The layers, by cost

Every host loads L0 on every session; everything else costs nothing until a request needs it. So the question for a new sentence is never "is it important?" but "does it have to be in the context of a session that is doing something else?".

| Layer | File | Loaded | Holds |
|---|---|---|---|
| L0 | `AGENTS.md` | every session, every host | the LOAD PROTOCOL + router, each Critical Rule's binding sentence, the behavioural layer (§2), the orchestration core (§3), the memory triggers |
| L1 | `.agents/instructions/agent-<id>.md` | when the router or a `ROUTE:` line names it | one request kind each: its rules, tables and pointers |
| L1, project | `.agents/instructions/agent-project.md` | routed by its own `triggers:` and its project context skills table | this project's own rules, key paths, accepted divergences and the rows of the skills it created; never synced |
| L2 | `.agents/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md` and `references/` | when the skill is invoked, or a reference is named | the HOW of one workflow: stages, flags, templates, doctrine |
| Knowledge | `.agents/skills/business-*-context/` and a project's own `<aspect>-context` | when a dispatch touches the aspect | judgment about the app (data, features, API), citing the maps |

## 2. The decision tree

Ask the questions in order and stop at the first yes.

```
Q1  Must it bind on EVERY turn, whatever the request is?
    (how the agent speaks and reasons, a Critical Rule, the LOAD PROTOCOL,
     how it dispatches subagents, when it saves memory, the router itself)
      yes -> L0, and only the binding sentence:
             - a Critical Rule: the sentence in AGENTS.md §1, the full text,
               rationale and examples in agent-critical-rules.md under the same
               number and name (the L0 line is a verbatim fragment of it)
             - a router row: see Q4, it is a decision, not an edit
      no  -> Q2

Q2  Is it true only for THIS project?
      knowledge about the app (entities, RLS, routes, screens, flows,
      vocabulary, how it is deployed)
          -> the matching business-*-context map (project-context mode
             data / features / api), or a project <aspect>-context skill
             (project-context mode context-skill)
      a rule, guardrail, key path or pointer for the agent working here
          -> agent-project.md, one heading per topic
      no  -> Q3

Q3  Does one skill own the workflow it describes (a stage, flags, a template,
    the syntax of a tool, a stage's doctrine)?
      yes -> that skill: references/ for the detail; one ## Compact Rules
             bullet as well when it must bind an executor (AGENTS.md §3 RULE
             REACHABILITY); a shared doctrine several skills cite goes in
             agentic-dev-core/references/
      no  -> Q4

Q4  Which REQUEST KIND needs it? Find the router row whose Kind covers it and
    write it in that row's Load section (agent-<id>.md).
      the section exists but prompts of that kind do not reach it
          -> widen that section's triggers: (or paths:), add the missed
             prompts to the eval set, let instructions:check score them
      no row's Kind covers it
          -> first try harder: rows are broad on purpose, and most "new
             kinds" are an existing kind seen from a new angle
          -> truly new: write the ADR that decides the new kind, add the row
             and its section, then `bun run instructions:check --accept-router
             ADR-NNNN` and cite the printed fingerprint in that ADR
```

## 3. Rules that hold whatever the tree answers

- **L0 never grows by prose.** A paragraph that explains a rule belongs in the rule's full text; a paragraph that explains a topic belongs in its section. L0 keeps the sentence that binds, and `bun run instructions:check` holds its byte budget.
- **A `NEVER` / `MUST` line in a section stays reachable** when the section is not loaded: it cites `Rule #N`, a skill whose `## Compact Rules` carry it, a contract label L0 also carries, or it declares `<!-- binds-in-section: <reason> -->`. `instructions:check` fails an orphan.
- **Committed prose names the source of truth, never its current value** (Critical Rule #17): no counts of sections, prompts or rows, no measured size, no claim about the present state. Measurements go in an ADR.
- **A synced file never holds a project fact.** Every section but `agent-project.md` is overwritten by `bun run up`; a project's rule, pointer or skill row goes in `agent-project.md`.
- **A trigger miss is fixed in `triggers:`, never by relabelling the eval set.** A false hit is fixed by narrowing the trigger. The set grows with every miss found, both languages when the trigger is bilingual.
- **A new section ships complete**: frontmatter (`id`, `title`, `load_when`, `triggers`, `paths`), a router row (which is an ADR, see Q4), at least three labelled prompts that expect its `id`, and a row in the `## Sections` table of `.agents/instructions/README.md`. `instructions:check` fails each missing piece.

## 4. Writes from other skills

A workflow skill whose own flow records a project fact writes that one place, `agent-project.md`, following §2 Q2 and §3, and closes with `bun run instructions:check`. The known writers:

| Skill | What it writes in `agent-project.md` |
|---|---|
| `project-context` | a missing key path after an artifact write (`## Key paths (this project)`); a project context skill's row and its triggers (mode `context-skill`) |
| `project-adoption` | the app's own facts the adoption plan approved (its key paths, its exceptions) |
| `testability-guide` | the pointer to the `/qa` page it registered |
| `git-flow-master` | the repository's own reading of its strategy and the reason for an accepted divergence (`## Git Strategy (this repository)`) |

None of them touches `AGENTS.md`, a synced section, the router or another section's `triggers:`; those changes run the procedure in §6.

## 5. Worked examples

1. **"Add to the credentials rule that a HAR file counts as a secret."** Q1 yes, but the rule exists: the addition goes in the full text of rule 1 in `agent-critical-rules.md`. The L0 sentence does not change, because it stays a verbatim fragment of the longer text; `instructions:check` fails a reworded L0 line.
2. **"Every PR the agent opens must link its story."** Q3: `git-flow-master` owns the PR body, so the detail goes in its `references/pr-templating.md`, and one compact rule bullet carries it to the executor that opens the PR.
3. **"Staging's database resets every night; never apply a migration near the reset."** Q2: the reset schedule is knowledge about the app, so it goes in the `business-data-context` map (through `project-context` mode `data`). The behavioural consequence is a rule for the agent in this project: a heading in `agent-project.md` that cites the map.
4. **"The Vercel CLI needs `--scope` on every call."** Q3: the syntax of one tool belongs to `vercel-cli` (`references/`). Nothing goes in a section: `agent-tool-resolution.md` only says which skill to load before the binary.
5. **"Prompts about Supabase migrations do not get the tool-resolution section."** Q4, a trigger miss: widen the `triggers:` of `agent-tool-resolution.md`, add the missed prompts (both languages) to `cli/lib/fixtures/instruction-router-eval.json` with the ids a careful reader would load, run `bun run instructions:check`: the eval scores the change in the same call and fails if the new trigger floods other prompts.
6. **"We need a router row for performance work."** Q4: performance work is developing or reviewing app code; the `agent-code-quickref.md` row and the `agent-context-map.md` row ("starting a task") already cover it. Grow that section's map and its `triggers:`. A row is added only when no Kind fits, through an ADR and `--accept-router`.
7. **"A teammate pasted thirty lines explaining our branching model into `AGENTS.md`."** Undo it: the git section (`agent-git.md`) is a pointer, the strategy itself is `git_strategy:` in `.agents/project.yaml`, and `git-flow-master` owns the policy. L0 keeps nothing of it.
8. **"Our team calls a story a 'card'; the agent should understand both words."** Q2: project vocabulary is knowledge about the app, so the matching context map gets the term. If prompts that say "card" then miss a project rule, the trigger goes in `agent-project.md`'s own `triggers:`, which the project owns; a synced section's `triggers:` are upstream's and the next `bun run up` would drop the edit.

## 6. The procedure

It is a plan, an edit and a verifier cut to the size of a text change.

1. **Place.** For each sentence, walk §2 and write one line: sentence -> file -> the question that decided it. A sentence that lands in a skill or in a context map leaves this procedure for that skill's own flow (`skill-creator` for a skill, `project-context` for a map).
2. **Router row?** A new, changed or removed router row is a decision: record the ADR (`references/adr-doctrine.md`; `Accepted` when the owner already approved the change), make the edit, run `bun run instructions:check --accept-router ADR-NNNN`, cite the fingerprint it prints in that ADR. Without the ADR the gate stays red; that is the lock working.
3. **Edit.** L0 takes binding sentences only (a Critical Rule's full text goes in `agent-critical-rules.md` first, the L0 line stays a verbatim fragment of it). A `triggers:` or `paths:` change adds the prompts that motivated it to `cli/lib/fixtures/instruction-router-eval.json`, labelled with what a careful reader of the router would load.
4. **New section?** Ship it complete (§3, last rule).
5. **Verify.** `bun run instructions:check` (budget, router, frontmatter, rules, binding, imports, the router lock, the eval, completeness), then `bun run docs:check` when a skill, script or doc path moved (the docs follow-through, `references/docs-follow-through.md`), then the quality gates of Critical Rule #6. A red gate is reported with its output, never worked around.
6. **Measure (optional).** `bun run instructions:audit` reports how often routed sections are actually read, from local transcripts; quote its overall number in the PR when the change is about routing.

## 7. Measuring the routes

The router eval proves the hook names the right section and keeps it on a binding `ROUTE:` line under the cap (binding recall); `bun run instructions:audit` measures whether the agent then read it, and how many reads followed a `ROUTE-PENDING:` reminder, from this machine's Claude Code transcripts (OpenCode and Codex transcripts are not parsed yet). It prints file names and counts only, never transcript text. A team that wants a trend can run it monthly (an Orca automation or a calendar reminder); the repo ships no routine for it.
