# Session Footer Contract (shared, chat-facing)

> Cited by: every skill marked `metadata.stage_owner: true` in its frontmatter (`REGISTRY.md` prints `stage owner` on their Source line). Utility and core skills are exempt: they run inside a workflow session that already honors this.

Chat-facing reporting contract: three things the AI surfaces to the human operator **without being asked**, at the close of every workflow session. None of them goes into a Jira comment, a PR body or a commit: those keep their own templates and voice. This contract governs the terminal / chat conversation only.

**Gate:** if you are about to tell the user a session or stage is done and you have not printed the blocks below, stop: you are not done reporting.

**Why it exists.** A business-outcome summary ("story shipped") hides the two questions the operator always asks next: what did this session actually touch (a migration? the API? a production deploy?) and is it really done (did Jira move, is the PR green, is the deploy READY)? Both are cheap to pre-empt and expensive to keep re-asking, and the second one is the one a success code answers wrongly (`AGENTS.md` Critical Rule #16).

---

## Part 1 — Evidence paths (whenever a capture exists)

Two trigger points; **both** apply:

**1a. Immediately.** The moment a screenshot, a recorded trace or a log excerpt worth keeping is captured (live-UI validation, a failing E2E, a deploy log), state its **repo-relative** path in chat in that same turn.

**1b. Consolidated at session close.** The final chat report lists every capture the session made, defects first.

```
### Evidence (relative paths)
- .session/sprint-development/<KEY>/evidence/<KEY>-live-ui-<label>.png
```

Rules:

- Omit the block when the session captured nothing; no empty headings.
- List only files verified on disk (`ls` the directory): never claim a capture a subagent only *said* it took.
- The session folder is working state at `<<PRIMARY_ROOT>>`, never the gitignored `.context/PBI/` cache (`AGENTS.md` §9): a capture that another machine or a reviewer needs goes to the PR (comment) or to Jira (attachment), and the footer says where.

## Part 2 — Session footer: tools used + dev surfaces touched

Printed once, at session / flow close, in chat:

- **Skills loaded**: every skill invoked this session (the orchestrating workflow skill itself, plus anything loaded inside it or inside its subagents).
- **MCPs used**: every MCP server actually *called* (not just connected), named by the capability it served (`mcp-capabilities.md` §2).
- **CLIs used**: every CLI actually invoked.
- **Dev surfaces touched**: one line per surface below, each with a one-clause note of WHAT was done there. Say **"none"** explicitly for a surface the work would normally touch but did not; never omit it silently, and never pad what did not happen.

| Surface | Means |
|---|---|
| DB / migration | schema, RLS, migration files, seed data; a migration APPLIED anywhere says where |
| API | route handlers, OpenAPI contract, generated types |
| UI | components, pages, navigation (live-UI validated or not) |
| Unit tests | tests written or changed, and whether they ran |
| E2E | end-to-end runs or specs |
| Staging deploy | the deployment for the pushed SHA, and its state |
| Production deploy | same; `none` is the common, correct answer |

```
### Session Footer — Tools & Dev Surfaces
Skills loaded: sprint-development, git-flow-master, vercel-cli, acli
MCPs used: db (supabase), library-docs (context7)
CLIs used: gh, vercel, bun (jira:sync-issues, test, types:check)
Dev surfaces touched:
- DB / migration — one migration adding `profiles.deleted_at`, applied to staging only
- API — none
- UI — profile settings page, live-UI validated against staging
- Unit tests — 6 new tests on the soft-delete helper, all green
- E2E — none (no suite in this project)
- Staging deploy — SHA abc1234 READY
- Production deploy — none
```

### Framing per skill

| Skill | "Dev surfaces touched" means |
|---|---|
| `sprint-development`, `autonomous-delivery` | what the story or bug actually changed and shipped, surface by surface |
| `project-bootstrap` | which layers were scaffolded (DB, API, UI, env, auth) |
| `project-adoption` | `none` for the app's own code, schema and CI by contract; name the agentic files written (`.agents/project.yaml`, `.env`, catalogs, the plan) |
| `project-foundation`, `product-management`, `design-system`, `testability-guide` | usually all `none` (definition work); name the artifact written instead in the skill's own report |

## Part 3 — Light stage verifier (closing checklist of every stage)

Every stage a stage owner runs closes with this. **"Light" means the agent answers each line from what it already did or read during the stage**, plus **at most ONE extra read per destination** to confirm the outcome at the destination, never at the receipt (Critical Rule #16). It is NOT a re-audit; its job is to catch the thing that was silently skipped.

```
Light stage verifier — <Stage name>
[ ] Tracker status — the issue re-read (bun run jira:sync-issues get <KEY>) shows the status this stage meant to reach
    (artifact-lifecycle.md §1: name the slug fired or verified, or the stated reason it was not)
[ ] Assignee — read back after every transition fired or verified (artifact-lifecycle.md §2), or stated N/A
[ ] Tracker writes — every field / comment this stage owns actually landed (re-read body, not the "created OK")
[ ] PR — exists, base branch matches the git strategy, `gh pr checks` state named (green / red / pending)
[ ] Migration — the schema or migration ledger re-read shows the change (db capability), or stated N/A
[ ] Deploy — the deployment for the pushed commit SHA reads READY (staging / production), or stated N/A
[ ] progress.md checkpoint appended (.session/<skill-slug>/<scope>/progress.md, session-management.md §7)
[ ] Session footer printed in chat (Part 2)
```

**Answering rules.** Every line is `YES` or a **stated** `N/A` with its reason: a blank line is a failed verifier, not a passed one. Any `NO` blocks the stage: fix it or surface it to the user, never advance past it. A destination that could not be read (no credentials, capability missing) is a `NO` with that reason, never a `YES` on the strength of the call's exit code.

A skill lists only its **stage-specific** lines inline (which issue, which deploy) and cites this template for the rest; the lines above are not repeated per skill.

## Multi-subagent aggregation rule

No single subagent sees the whole session: the **orchestrator** is the one place that can compile the footer and the verifier. Either every stage subagent's report carries the fields below and the orchestrator unions them at close (preferred for dispatch-heavy flows), or the orchestrator records them as it dispatches. Either way the footer is compiled ONCE, at the very end, never per stage or per subagent.

### Briefing snippet (paste into component 6, Report format)

> **Session-footer fields (mandatory in your structured report):** `skills_loaded` (array), `mcps_used` (array), `clis_used` (array), `dev_surfaces_touched` (array of `{surface, note}`; include a `{surface, note: "none"}` entry for any surface your stage would normally touch but did not), `evidence_captured` (array of repo-relative paths). Never drop a field; report an empty array explicitly.
